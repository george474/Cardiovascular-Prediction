# Cardiovascular-Prediction
Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbour on Heart disease dataset

 using KNN algorithm, to predict whether a patient is likely to have cardiovascular disease or not based on features that we have collected. 
 However, it is important to note that KNN is not a perfect model and may not always produce accurate predictions. 
 It is always recommended to use multiple algorithms and perform thorough testing before making any conclusions.
 For our case here we have applied randomforrest and xtreem gradient boosting and regression analysis.
