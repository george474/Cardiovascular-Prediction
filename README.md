# Cardiovascular-Prediction
Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbour on Heart disease dataset

 using KNN algorithm, to predict whether a patient is likely to have cardiovascular disease or not based on the features that we have collected. 
 However, it is important to note that KNN is not a perfect model and may not always produce accurate predictions. 
 It is always recommended to use multiple algorithms and perform thorough testing before making any conclusions.
